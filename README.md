# Arboverse

Arboviruses geographic info

## Quick setup
Note: when running commands in docker, your .env needs to have the PGSQL host as db. When running code from the terminal here, you need the .env to reflect the host as localhost.

### Running for the First Time

0. Clone this project
1. Install [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Once in its root, run `docker-compose build`
3. Start the database with `docker-compose up -d db`
4. Then `docker-compose run --rm web sh -c 'python manage.py sqlcreate && python manage.py migrate'`
5. And finally `docker-compose up -d`. Every other time, this is all you'll need.

### Running every other time

When you're working, just run `docker-compose up -d`. **The system will be
available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)**

This will run the project in the background. To stop,
do `docker-compose down`.

If you do not want to run it in the background,
ommit the `-d` flag, `docker-compose up`

## Seeing the Logs

Got stuck somewhere? You can see the logs with `docker-compose logs`.

If you're only interested in Django's logs, run `docker-compose logs web`.
If you're only interested in database's logs, run `docker-compose logs db`.

## Using the Shell

Our Django  setup comes with a very handy [super shell](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html). It is useful to interact with our code in a REPL
shell.

Run it with `docker-compose run --rm web python manage.py shell_plus`

## Running Tests

`docker-compose run --rm web pytest`

## Developing Locally

0. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv env`
1. Activate it `source env/bin/activate`
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements/local.txt`

## Setup pre-commit

0. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
1. Run `pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t pre-push`
2. Optional: you may run all hooks with `pre-commit run --all`


## Prod Setup

1. Copy `sample.env` to `.env` -> `cp sample.env .env`
2. Run `python manage.py collectstatic` and ensure that the resulting folder will be web-accessible.
